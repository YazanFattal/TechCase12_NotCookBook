Tech Case 12: Not a cookbook
Create a recipe/cookbook app with the following functionality:

User can see a list of recipes, click on a recipe to view the ingredients needed for the recipe.
On the recipe screen the user can make a picture of a meal. For instance a hamburger with fries or a plate with spaghetti. Using AI the image is processed and the ingredients that the AI algorithm finds are added to the recipe. You can write the AI yourself or use a third party API.
Non functionals: recipes are stored in a database on a server. You can make the server yourself or use a third party system.
